Lab 5 — Edge Detection and Segmentation

Course: Mathematical Algorithms (DSP) — Image Processing
Topic: Edge detection, gradients, zero-crossings, Otsu thresholding, segmentation

Overview

This lab explores how edges correspond to high-frequency components in images. Gradient-based and zero-crossing operators are applied, and segmentation is performed using Otsu’s automatic thresholding.

Edges and High-Frequency Components

Edges correspond to rapid intensity changes, which are high-frequency components, and derivative operators highlight these changes for edge detection.

Gradient-Based Edge Detection

The Sobel operator adds smoothing and produces cleaner edges, while the Prewitt operator is simpler and more sensitive to noise.

Canny Edge Detector

The Canny edge detector is a multi-stage method including Gaussian smoothing, gradient computation, non-maximum suppression, and hysteresis thresholding. It produces thin, continuous edges and effectively suppresses noise.

Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)

LoG detects edges as zero-crossings of the second derivative, capturing fine details but can be noise-sensitive.

Otsu’s Automatic Thresholding

Otsu’s method selects a threshold that maximizes the separation between background and foreground, useful for simple segmentation based on the image histogram.

Labeling and Visualization

Connected regions in the binary mask are labeled and color-coded for visualization.

-Why Canny outperforms gradient filters: smoothing, accurate gradient computation, non-maximum suppression, and edge linking

-Otsu and histogram thresholding: threshold maximizes between-class variance
