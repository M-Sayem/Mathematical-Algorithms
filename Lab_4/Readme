Lab 4 — Noise and Filtering

Course: Mathematical Algorithms (DSP) — Image Processing
Topic: Noise modelling, MSE/SNR evaluation, linear and nonlinear filtering

This lab explores how Gaussian and salt-and-pepper noise affect an image, evaluates distortion using MSE and SNR, and compares three filtering methods: mean, Gaussian, and median filtering.

1. Adding Noise (Gaussian and Salt-and-Pepper)

Two common noise models were added to the grayscale peppers image:

Gaussian noise (mean = 0, variance = 0.01)

Salt-and-pepper noise with a density of 0.05

Observation:
Gaussian noise appears as fine, grain-like variations, while salt-and-pepper noise produces strong black and white impulse spikes.

2. Quality Metrics (MSE and SNR)

The distortion introduced by each noise type was quantified using Mean Square Error (MSE) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

Measured Results
Noise Type	MSE	SNR (dB)
Gaussian	0.0096	11.5114 dB
Salt & Pepper	0.0158	9.3372 dB

Interpretation:

Salt-and-pepper noise has a higher MSE, meaning it introduces stronger pixel-level distortion.

Gaussian noise has a higher SNR, indicating it is less visually disruptive overall.

3. Linear Filtering (Mean & Gaussian Filters)

Two linear smoothing filters were applied:

Mean Filter (3×3)

Slightly reduces Gaussian noise

Performs poorly for impulse noise

Causes noticeable blurring of edges and details

Gaussian Filter (σ = 0.7)

Better suited for Gaussian noise due to its statistical match

Produces smoother and more natural results than the mean filter

Still ineffective for removing salt-and-pepper noise

4. Nonlinear Filtering (Median Filter)

The median filter (3×3) was applied to both noise types.

Why the median filter?
It effectively removes isolated outlier pixels (salt-and-pepper noise) while preserving edges, unlike linear filters which blur intensity transitions.

5. Filter Performance — MSE After Filtering
Salt-and-Pepper Noise
Filter	MSE
Average Filter	0.0021
Median Filter	0.0001

Conclusion:
The median filter is far more effective for salt-and-pepper noise.
The average filter reduces noise slightly but leaves many impulse pixels and introduces blur.

Gaussian Noise
Filter	MSE
Average Filter	0.0013
Median Filter	0.0019

Conclusion:
For Gaussian noise, the average filter performs better than the median filter.
Median filtering is not designed for Gaussian-distributed noise, which explains its slightly worse performance.
