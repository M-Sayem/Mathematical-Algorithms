# Lab 7 — Noise Modelling and Filtering

**Course:** Mathematical Algorithms (DSP) — Image Processing  
**Topic:** Gaussian Noise, PSNR/SSIM Evaluation, Traditional vs AI Denoising

## Learning Outcomes

- Model common noise types in MATLAB (Gaussian).
- Measure image quality using MSE, PSNR, and SSIM.
- Compare the effectiveness of traditional filters (Mean, Median, Gaussian blur, Wiener).
- Evaluate the performance of an AI-based denoiser (DnCNN).

## Expected Results

- Noisy images show reduced PSNR and SSIM.
- Wiener filter improves quality with moderate smoothing.
- DnCNN produces the highest PSNR/SSIM and best visual quality.
