1) Why does ideal LP cause ringing (Gibbs phenomenon)?
   -A sharp cutoff in frequency creates a sinc in space → oscillations near edges.

2) What does fftshift do visually?
  -Moves the DC component to the center so high frequencies appear symmetrically.

3) When is frequency-domain filtering preferable?
  -When the kernel (PSF) is large—FFT-based convolution is far faster.
